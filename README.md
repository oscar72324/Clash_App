This clash royale app ingests the official Clash Royale API where the user can search their real player tag, clan, clan members, and more. Not only can you search for players and clans, you can also check the official global ranking in North America, as well as the cards available in the game with a brief descriptive description of each one. Finally, you can check upcoming challenges in the game, the included prizes, losses and wins necessary, and more. (Unfortunately due to the API being bound to my IP Address, I was unable to host the application which means I cannot provide a demo).
